# Analysis on a survey on mobile app usage 
##### unsupervised learning

After data analysis, we found out an outstanding need in mobile app: listening to music,
recording/editing videos. The component is identified as having a strong need for music
&amp; video and whose audience is willing to pay for the service. By looking at plots on
demography, this group of people is across gender, across age 35-59, across all education
level from high school to post-graduate, across all ethnicity, across people at all marital
status and households at a different level. Because of the wide age range of customers,
we ensure that there is a huge potential for market needs and that it would be profitable
because they are willing to pay.
